UNIT 4 Notes

Objectives: 
	1. Use Chrome DevTools to debug JavaScript
	2. Utilize jQuery to create Web Pages

*CHROME DEV TOOLS*
	-Debugging tools (Press F12)
	*ELEMENTS*
		allows you to view DOM elements and their attributes
		can select elements individually
	*SOURCES*
		used to debug JS
		*Console Drawer*
			to launch press 'esc' key ;
			code written in here executes and can be recorded
				i.e. parseint(addend1) + parseint(addend2)
		*Code Editor*
			used to make changes once you determine the issue
			make any changes then click 'ctrl + s'
			^ only updates code in browser, not at server level

*JQUERY*
	A JS library designed to make DOM manipulation, ajax interactions, and animating easier
	- https://jquery.com/
		consists of functions we use to simplify things

	*to use jQuery, add the libraries to your pages
	- download the file and place it in a folder
	- or link to: https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js
		   or https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-3.1.1.min.js
	
	TO ACCESS JQUERY USE: $("")
	1. inside the double quotes, select the element you want to work with
	i.e. $("#p1") //# to select an element by its id //. to select an element by its class
	2. after you select an element, you specify an action
	
	Setting Values of Elements
	use '.text()' to set the text of an element
	use '.html()' to set the html of an element

	*EVENTS*
	Most DOM events have cooresponding jQuery events
	Difference: you must pass a function to the event to handle the event
		i.e. $("btnSubmit").click(function(){$("p").hide})

	.append() - will add an item to the end of an element
	.remove() - will remove an element
	.val() - the value within a certain element
