Unit 5 Class Notes

JSON = JS Object Notation
 * used to organize data for transfer and storage
 * provides a standardized way to format data
 * several technologies store data in HSON format instead of relational databases
 * FORMAT: data in name/value pairs, commas separate the data, objects are delimited by curly braces, arrays use []
	   "name":"value", "name":"value" ,... (name is almost always some sort of string)
 * an Object is a collection of name, value pairs
 * an Array is a collection of objects
   If you want to group the name:value pairs to make an object -> {"school":"TCC", "prof":"Oliverio"}
 * to make an array: 
	"faculty":[{"name":"Ali","color":"green"},{"name":"Brad","color":"red"},{"name":"Josh","color":"orange"}]

JSON and JavaScript
 JS contains the JSON object which allows us to work with JSON uing JS
 You can put '' quotes around an object to make it JSON or you can stringify it
 2 useful methods that allow us to do this: 
	1. JSON.parse()		- reads a string and returns the values from the string
		*used to turn JSON string into a diff type of object
		*strips specific values so that we can use them
		 i.e. JSON.parse(exampleJSON);
		      document.getElementById("div1").innerHTML = parsedJSON.name

	2. JSON.stringify()	- converts string to JSON for storage or sending
		*used to convert JS object into JSON (i.e. arrays and objects)
		*primarily used to convert JS to JSON that can be sent to a server for exchange information
		 i.e. var obj = {"city":"VB", "state":"VA"};
		      var convertedJSON = JSON.stringify(obj);

API (Application Program Interface) - 
 * govern how applications interact with each other
 * allows Web Apps to reuse and access remote code (i.e. lets Waze use Google's map database)
 * Often web services that return data in the form of JSON, etc.
 * Usually contain functions/methods that can be called remotely by the web sites/apps
   i.e. GPS, Weather, Stat Updates, cloud based services, etc.
 
 Different Types of APIs: 
	1. Native APIs
	2. Third Party APIs

 How do we use APIs?
	XMLHTTPRequest is the JS function used to access APIs
		- problems when going across domains because many servers don't allow it due to cross-site scripting attacks
		    - these attacks allow attackers to insert malicious code on a server that will run on a users machine when they hit a site
	fetch is used instead of XMLHTTPRequest now
	HTTP Request Methods are used with APIs 
		- GET method 
		- POST method

Storage
 web storage API allows browsers to store key/value pairs (can be used instead of cookies)
 TWO TYPES = 1. sessionStorage (avail. while page's session is open)
	     2. localStorage (avail. even when the browser is closed and reopened)

 localStorage = on hard drive
	- has no expiration date ; persists even when browser closes
	- useful when you have items that you need to save
	- uses key value pairs
	- use .setItem() to save to localStorage
	- use .getItem() to retrieve data from localStorage
	- use localStorage.clear() to clear the data

 sessionStorage = in web page
	- has an expiration date ; is cleared when the page session ends and browser is closed
	- while browser is open, data can persist in sessionStorage
	- use .setItem() to save data to sessionStorage
	- use .getItem() to retrieve data from sessionStorage
	- use sessionlStorage.clear() to clear the data
