Geolocation
-used to identify your location in web apps
-done through use of GPS and latt/longitude coordinates
-several APIs that deal with Geolocation
-done using Wi-Fi, IP addresses, GPS hardware, and cell tower triangulation

Client/Server Side
-Client side runs on client's device
  -specifically for user interface
-Server side runs on the server
  -used for calculations, data access, transformation, and heavy performance and efficiency

Node.js
-a runtime environment used to build scalable network/server applications
-built on top of Google Chrome V8 JS engine
-based on an asynchronous event-driven, nonblocking I/O model
	- asynchronous: deals with requests as if it's multitasking
-Node.js platform can serve as a full web server similar to apache
-Can run on several platforms including Windows, Linux, Mac OS X

IN NODE.JS
Command Prompt
-cd = change directory
	i.e. cd c:\Program Files\nodejs
-dir = directory (shows all folders in current folder)
In order to run something in node, you have to be 'pointing' to the folder that contains the file
npm = node project manager

require is how you add module/ argument is the module you want to add
i.e. require('http') gives you web server code

.createServer creates a server
request and response are objects in node // i.e. function(request, response)

.writeHead(code, json) = how you write the head/info not displayed
response.end(what goes in body) = end of message
*json = {"content-type": "text/plain"}

.listen() = listens for requests so it can send responses
		your argument in this case is the port that this code is running on

console.log = how we write messages to the command line
