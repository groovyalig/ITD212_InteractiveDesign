can be manually entered, but not recommended

findOne method
use find() to find an item in mongoDB
-this usually returns all of the documents in the collection
-we usually return these as an array and must loop through 
	the array in order to access the documents
use findOne() to find a single document
 - db.collection.findOne() returns the first document
		.findOne({'name':'Alissa'}) returns first instance that
		   meets that criterion
